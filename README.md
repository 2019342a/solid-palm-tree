Data Visualisation Project that follows the Data Visualisation Tutorial form the website: newcoder http://newcoder.io
# The project
The project takes a sample data, parse the sample data from columns and rows to a list of dictionaries, then render that data in two different graphs and in GitHub as a map.

The sample data that is included is a snapshot of public crime filings from the San Franncisco police. This is the data provided by the tutorial. More data may be included later.
